# Categorical realizability

Lecture notes with exercises for the advanced course on **categorical
realizability** at the [Midlands Graduate School (MGS)
2024](https://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/mgs2024).

*The notes are currently under construction. An abstract and a link to the notes
will appear soon.*

#### What can I expect from the course?

If you like logic, computability theory and/or category theory, then this course
should be of interest to you!\
While familiarity with basic category theory is definitely helpful, I'm hopeful
that you can get plenty out of the course without knowing any category theory.
