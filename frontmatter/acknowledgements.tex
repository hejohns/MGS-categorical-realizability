\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my thanks to Jaap van Oosten---to whom I have dedicated these notes---for introducing me to realizability when I was a master's student in
mathematics at Utrecht University back in 2015--2018.

For the illustration on the title page I adapted \verb|tikz| code from
\emph{AboAmmar}'s answer on \TeX\ StackExchange~\cite{latex-triangle}.
