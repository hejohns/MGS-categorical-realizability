\chapter{Acknowledgements}

It is my pleasure to express my sincere thanks to Jaap van Oosten---to whom I
have dedicated these notes---for teaching an excellent course on category
theory~\cite{vanOosten2016} and introducing me to realizability when I was a
master's student in mathematics at Utrecht University back in 2015--2018.

I thank Rahul Chhabra, Stefania Damato, Johnson He, Alyssa Renata and Mark
Williams for pointing out or fixing typos.
